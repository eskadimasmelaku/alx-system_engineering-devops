Postmortem: The Great Traffic Jam of 2024
Issue Summary: When the Load Balancer Played Favorites
Duration:
This “nail-biter” lasted 3 hours, from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM UTC on August 10, 2024.

Impact:
Think of it like everyone in the city decided to drive through a single toll booth at rush hour. Our web app was that toll booth, and it wasn’t pretty. Around 60% of our users were left stuck in traffic, experiencing slow load times, or worse—watching the dreaded spinning wheel of doom. This led to a 40% drop in user engagement and a customer support meltdown that we’re still recovering from.

Root Cause:
Turns out, our load balancer was having a bad day. It decided to send 80% of the traffic to one server—because, apparently, that server was its best friend. Unfortunately, the server couldn’t handle the love and eventually crashed, dragging its friends down with it.


Timeline: The Unfolding Drama
1:00 PM: Monitoring system freaks out and sends an alert about high latency on the web app. (Cue dramatic music.)
1:05 PM: Our hero, the on-call engineer, dives into action.
1:15 PM: The engineer suspects the database—because databases are always guilty, right? Wrong. No smoking gun here.
1:30 PM: The plot thickens as load balancing metrics show that traffic is being funneled unevenly.
1:45 PM: A wild goose chase begins, with suspicions of rogue code changes—only to realize that no one’s pushed anything in days. (False alarm!)
2:00 PM: It’s time to call in the cavalry: the DevOps team is brought into the fray.
2:15 PM: DevOps discovers that one backend server is drowning in traffic. Cue the “aha!” moment.
2:30 PM: The load balancer settings are reviewed, and the misconfiguration is found—dun dun dun!
2:45 PM: A temporary traffic reroute saves the day (for now).
3:30 PM: The load balancer is reconfigured correctly, and servers are restarted to clear any lingering gremlins.
4:00 PM: The crisis is over, and the app is back to its usual smooth self.
Root Cause and Resolution: The Tale of the Rogue Load Balancer
Root Cause:
Imagine inviting 100 people to a party but only letting 80 of them into one room while the other rooms remain empty. That’s what happened here. Our load balancer was set to favor one server, overloading it until it broke down. The poor server couldn’t handle the stress, and its failure created a domino effect that left our other servers scrambling.

Resolution:
We slapped some sense into the load balancer by manually redistributing traffic to calm things down. Then, we fixed the misconfiguration, making sure traffic was spread evenly across all servers. A quick restart of the servers ensured everything was back to normal, and the load balancer was given a stern talking-to.

Corrective and Preventative Measures: Lessons Learned (the Hard Way)
Improvements:

Smarter Monitoring: We’re adding alerts for any weird traffic patterns that could signal a load balancer revolt.
Automation, Baby: We’ll automate tests to catch load balancer shenanigans before they mess things up.
Documentation Refresh: The load balancer manual is getting an update, with a section titled “How Not to Break Everything.”
To-Do List:

Patch That Balancer: Double-check and update all load balancer configurations across the board.
Traffic Monitoring: Implement specific monitoring for load distribution to avoid another meltdown.
CI/CD Enhancements: Integrate automated load balancer configuration tests into our CI/CD pipeline.
Team Training: DevOps team will undergo load balancer training—no more guessing games!
Update Docs: Refresh the internal documentation to prevent future mishaps.
